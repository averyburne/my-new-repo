House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned doesn't tell Cersei that he knows about her and Jaime like and idiot, and he also doesn't trust Littlefinger to get the city watch on his side. Stannis comes in and totally bodies Joffrey.
